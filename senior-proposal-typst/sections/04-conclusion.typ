== Summary and Conclusion

Safe Dip is a safety-oriented pick-dip-place system designed to reduce worker exposure to the hazards associated with manual hot-melt coating operations. The proposed design uses a two-axis Cartesian gantry to detect, acquire, transport, dip, and release a workpiece without requiring the operator to remain near the dipping area.

The system is controlled by an STM32 microcontroller that coordinates the stepper-driven horizontal and vertical axes, the time-of-flight sensor, limit switches, electromagnet, emergency-stop input, and communication interfaces. Serial communication provides the baseline operator interface, while Modbus TCP through the W5500 module allows system states, sensor information, and fault conditions to be observed by external equipment.

Safety is a central consideration in the design. A normally-closed, twist-reset emergency-stop button immediately removes power from the movement subsystem, while the conventional electromagnet remains powered from a separate supply so that actuating the movement emergency stop does not intentionally release the suspended workpiece. Fuses are also included in the prototype power branches to reduce the consequences of electrical faults.

The laboratory prototype will be tested without a heated coating bath and will handle a workpiece of approximately 1 lb under controlled conditions. Successful testing would demonstrate the feasibility of the control, sensing, communication, movement, and emergency-stop architecture, but it would not validate operation at the intended industrial temperature. The conventional electromagnet also cannot provide load retention during a complete loss of magnet power, which remains an important prototype limitation.

Overall, Safe Dip proposes a lower-cost and modular alternative to manual dipping and more expensive industrial robotic systems. The project provides a foundation for determining whether the design can later be developed into a guarded, temperature-rated, and industrially deployable machine.

== Suggestions for Future Work

Future development should first address the safeguards required for operation near a heated coating bath. These additions may include a transparent physical enclosure, interlocked access points, independent overtemperature protection, spill containment, and visual and audible status indicators.

The main focus of future improvents would be to harden the system by providing thermal protection to the mechanism. The conventional electromagnet may also be replaced by an electro-permanent magnet, mechanically locking gripper, or another end effector capable of retaining the workpiece during a complete power failure. Additional sensing could verify that the workpiece has been successfully acquired before movement begins.

Further improvements may include closed-loop position feedback, enhanced fault monitoring, a dedicated operator interface, and standardized communication with upstream and downstream conveyor equipment. After these safeguards are implemented, the system could be evaluated using the intended coating material and operating temperature to measure retention, positioning accuracy, dip consistency, and long-term reliability.

Also, because the electromagnet is deliberately held during an emergency stop, it depends on its 12 V supply remaining available. A planned future improvement is to add a small backup battery on the electromagnet rail, sized to hold the coil energized for a few minutes in the event of a total power loss, so that a suspended part is not dropped when mains power is lost rather than merely when the E-stop is actuated
