= Abstract

Manual hot-dip coating operations expose workers to elevated temperatures, repetitive strain, and the risk of burns from hot, viscous materials. This project presents Safe Dip, a two-axis Cartesian gantry designed to automate the pick, dip, and place cycle while reducing direct operator exposure. The system provides controlled workpiece positioning, immersion depth, dwell time, and transfer between fixed input, dipping, and output stations.

An STM32 microcontroller coordinates the complete sequence through a cooperative, nonblocking control architecture. Horizontal motion is produced by a stepper-driven timing belt and linear rails, while a stepper-driven leadscrew controls the vertical axis. A conventional electromagnet handles ferromagnetic workpieces, a time-of-flight sensor detects their presence, and normally-closed limit switches provide homing and travel references. Serial and Modbus TCP communications report operating states, sensor information, and fault conditions.

Safety is treated as a primary design consideration. A hardwired Category 0 emergency-stop circuit removes power from the motor drivers independently of the microcontroller, while the electromagnet remains on a separate supply to avoid intentionally releasing a suspended workpiece during a motion stop. The laboratory prototype will be evaluated without a heated coating bath and will demonstrate the integration of the mechanical, electrical, sensing, control, communication, and safety subsystems. Supporting calculations evaluate the design's scalability toward the intended 10 kg payload.
